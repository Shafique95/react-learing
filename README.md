## 🧭 Routing Strategy

- Each module defines its own routes in a `routes.tsx` file.
- All routes are aggregated inside `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx` using `useRoutes`.
- Layouts like `MainLayout` wrap feature components based on need.

Example:
```tsx
// routes/AppRoutes.tsx
import { useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";
import employeeRoutes from "../modules/employees/routes";
import authRoutes from "../modules/auth/routes";
import paymentRoutes from "../modules/payment/routes";

export default function AppRoutes() {
  return useRoutes([
    ...employeeRoutes,
    ...authRoutes,
    ...paymentRoutes,
  ]);
}
````

## 🧠 Why Modular (Feature-Based) Structure?

* ✅ Easier to **scale** and **maintain**
* ✅ Allows **parallel development** by teams
* ✅ Improves **code reusability** and **separation of concerns**
* ✅ Ideal for learning enterprise-level patterns

---

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🔧 Future Improvements

* [ ] Integrate Zustand or Redux Toolkit
* [ ] Add API mocking with MSW
* [ ] Add form validation with Zod or Yup
* [ ] Setup tests with Vitest / React Testing Library
* [ ] Implement dark mode toggle

Let me know if you want a version that includes:
- Zustand state management
- Authentication flow (login/signup)
- Or hosted as a GitHub repo or ZIP download!

I can generate the whole project with this structure too. ✅
